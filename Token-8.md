# Token

In blockchain, ‘token’ is a term that generally represents digital assets. A token refers to a digital asset that is created and transferable on a specific blockchain platform. Tokens are created and managed through smart contracts, which are an application of blockchain technology.

### Tokens can be used for various purposes. Here are detailed explanations of tokens:
  
-Cryptocurrency Tokens: Cryptocurrency tokens represent digital currencies on the blockchain platform. Examples of such tokens include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These types of tokens can be transferred, stored, and exchanged for value on the blockchain network.

-Utility Tokens: Utility tokens represent access to the services of a specific blockchain platform or project. These types of tokens allow users to purchase special services, products, or functions on the platform. For example, the utility tokens of a project running on the Ethereum network can be used to access specific features of the project.

-Security Tokens: Security tokens are tokens that represent traditional financial assets (such as stocks, bonds, real estate). These types of tokens enable the representation of securities on the blockchain. Security tokens can offer traditional financial rights to investors, such as ownership or revenue sharing.

-Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Non-fungible tokens represent unique and non-interchangeable digital assets. Each NFT can have its own identity and characteristics. These types of tokens are used to represent digital assets such as digital art, collections, and in-game items.

Tokens are created, programmed, and managed through smart contract mechanisms on the blockchain. Token holders can transfer, store, and use these tokens on the blockchain network. Tokens facilitate digital asset transfers with the decentralized, secure, and transparent nature of blockchain technology and can be applied in various industries.
