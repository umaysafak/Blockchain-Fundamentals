# Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of ensuring the security of communication by using mathematical and computational methods to encrypt information, provide authentication, and ensure privacy. Essentially, cryptography transforms messages or data into an unintelligible form, allowing only authorized recipients to understand them.

The primary purpose of cryptography is to use encryption and decryption processes to hide or secure information. The encryption process transforms plaintext into ciphertext, while the decryption process converts ciphertext back into plaintext. These operations are performed by cryptographic algorithms.

##  The main objectives of cryptography are as follows:
  
-Confidentiality: Cryptography ensures that information is understandable only to authorized individuals. Encrypting the information prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing it and ensures confidentiality.

-Integrity: Cryptography verifies that data has not been altered and maintains its integrity. Methods such as data encryption and digital signatures ensure data integrity and make it possible to detect data manipulation.

-Authentication: Cryptography enables the process of authenticating the identities of participants. The identities of the parties involved in communication are verified using digital certificates and digital signatures.

-Authorization: Cryptography grants users permission to perform specific operations through authorization mechanisms. The accuracy of operations and the authorization process are provided by cryptographic protocols.

##    The common usage areas of cryptography include the following:
  
-Internet Security: Cryptography uses SSL/TLS protocols to secure communication between web browsers. These protocols enable data encryption and authentication processes.

-Email Security: Cryptography ensures the confidentiality and integrity of communication by encrypting emails and using digital signatures.

-Mobile Communication: Cryptography ensures the security of communication conducted through mobile phones. The encryption algorithms used in mobile communication protect data security and privacy.

-Data Storage: Cryptography ensures the encryption of data in data storage systems. This way, unauthorized access to the data is prevented and it is securely stored.

-Electronic Payments: Cryptography is used in digital currencies and blockchain-based payment systems. Encrypting transactions enables secure transfers to take place.

-Business Security: Cryptography is used to protect the data of businesses. By implementing cryptographic methods in internal networks and communications, security is ensured.

Cryptography plays a significant role in areas such as secure and trustworthy communication, data protection, and identity authentication. By employing advanced mathematical computations and cryptographic algorithms, it becomes possible to securely transmit and safeguard information.
