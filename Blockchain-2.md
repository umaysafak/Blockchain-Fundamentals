# Blockchain

Blockchain is a technology where data and transactions are shared over a distributed network and stored securely. Essentially, blockchain keeps data in a chain of interconnected blocks. Each block contains one or more transactions and the blocks are linked to each other with a hash, which is a mathematically calculated value.

One of the most important features of blockchain is that it allows data to be securely shared without the need for a central authority or intermediary. This makes blockchain decentralized and transparent. Data is copied between nodes on a distributed network and each node holds a complete copy of the blockchain.

The security of blockchain is ensured through cryptography and consensus mechanisms. Transactions are cryptographically protected and verified before being added to blocks. Consensus mechanisms ensure agreement between nodes on the blockchain network and help prevent false or erroneous transactions.
