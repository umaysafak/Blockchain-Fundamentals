# Smart Contract

A Smart Contract is a programmable contract that operates with blockchain technology and is executed automatically. It is a coded digital version of traditional contracts and has the ability to perform certain actions when certain conditions are met.

Smart contracts are special accounts on the blockchain network that can perform transactions, store data, and have programmable functions. These contracts follow a specific logic and algorithm to perform transactions. A smart contract is automatically triggered and performs certain actions when predefined conditions are met.

### The basic features of smart contracts are:
  
-Identity: Smart contracts provide an agreement between two or more parties, similar to traditional contracts. However, smart contracts can be more precise and predictable because they are in a coded digital form.

-Programmability: Smart contracts have programmable functions that can perform certain actions when certain conditions are met. This can automate transactions such as making payments, transferring assets, storing data, and managing accounts.

-Security: Smart contracts are highly secure because they operate with blockchain technology. Since the code of the contracts is transparently accessible and verifiable, the risk of manipulation is reduced.

-Decentralization: Smart contracts operate without the need for a central authority or intermediary. This allows for direct interaction between parties and increases trustworthiness.

Smart contracts have many different application areas. They can be used as a payment mechanism in cryptocurrencies, for asset tokenization and management, and for the implementation of financial products such as insurance contracts and financial derivatives. They can also be used for supply chain management, voting systems, real estate transactions, and many other areas.

Smart contracts are one of the most powerful features of blockchain technology because they provide automatic execution and programmability. These contracts enable transactions to be carried out and agreements to be implemented in a secure, transparent, and efficient manner.
