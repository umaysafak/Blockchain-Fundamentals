# Interoperability

Interoperability refers to the ability to seamlessly share data, assets or transactions between different blockchain or blockchain networks. It means that different blockchain protocols or networks can be integrated and interact in a way that provides interoperability and data transfer.

With the evolution of blockchain technology, situations such as the emergence of different blockchain networks and the development of specialized blockchains for various use cases have arisen. However, these different blockchain networks often have difficulties interacting with each other.

Interoperability enables data and asset transfer, transaction tracking and verification between different blockchain networks. Thus, smart contracts, asset tokens or other data created on different blockchain networks can be transmitted and used between different networks.

### The significant advantages of Interoperability include:

-Data sharing: Data sharing between different blockchain networks facilitates collaboration and integration. For example, data sharing between a healthcare organization and an insurance company can enable better service to patients.

-Asset transfer: The transfer of asset tokens or digital assets between different blockchain networks can have a liquidity-enhancing effect. This allows users to freely move assets created on different networks.

-Application interaction: Interaction between different blockchain networks enables multiple applications or services to become interoperable. This increases the integration and efficiency of business processes.

-Collaboration and network effect: Interaction between different blockchain networks creates a broader ecosystem and increases collaboration opportunities. This encourages innovation and strengthens the network effect.

Interoperability helps to increase the wider adoption and use cases of blockchain technology. Blockchain projects and developers seek solutions to interoperability issues by creating standards and developing compatible protocols.
