# Distributed Ledger

Distributed Ledger refers to a database that is maintained in a decentralized structure and shared among multiple participants. Traditionally, data is stored in a database managed by a central authority or central server, while distributed ledger technology allows data to be securely stored and distributed among participants.

Distributed ledger can operate on protocols or systems such as blockchain technology. In these technologies, data is grouped into blocks and each new block contains a reference to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks. Each participant keeps a copy of the distributed ledger and approves updates.

### The main features of distributed ledger technology are as follows:
  
-Distribution: Data is distributed among all participants in the network. Each participant keeps a full copy and shares updates with other participants. This allows data to be securely stored without being dependent on a single central point.

-Consensus: Consensus mechanisms are used to accept updates in the distributed ledger. Participants must agree on the addition of a new block or the approval of changes. This ensures data integrity and reliability.

-Traceability: Each block and transaction in the distributed ledger can be traced and audited. All participants can verify past transactions and follow the blockchain backwards. This provides transparency and accountability.

-Security: Data in the distributed ledger is secured using cryptographic methods. Each transaction is verified through digital signatures and encryption, preventing manipulation. Data integrity and security are ensured.

Distributed ledger technology can be applied in many areas such as financial transactions, supply chain management, voting systems, and health records. It provides transparent and secure data sharing without the need for a central authority. Having multiple copies of the same data set prevents data loss and ensures that data remains accessible even if a single point in the system fails.
