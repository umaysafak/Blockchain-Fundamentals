# Hard Fork ve Soft Fork

In Blockchain, the term ‘fork’ refers to the splitting of the blockchain network into two or more branches at a certain point. A fork is used to make changes to the blockchain protocol or to replicate an existing version of the blockchain. A fork can occur due to a software or protocol change in the blockchain or due to differing views or goals within the blockchain community.

Hard Fork and Soft Fork are updates or changes that occur in blockchain networks. Both can cause the existing blockchain to split and create a new version. However, there are some fundamental differences between Hard Fork and Soft Fork. Here are detailed explanations of Hard Fork and Soft Fork:

## Hard Fork:
  
A Hard Fork is an update in the blockchain network where backward-incompatible changes are made. This type of update means that the fundamental rules of the blockchain have changed and compatibility with past blocks is broken. When a Hard Fork occurs, the validity of the existing blockchain is not accepted and a new blockchain is created.

A Hard Fork is usually carried out to make a significant change to the blockchain protocol, add new features or solve an existing problem. For example, the split between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum, which was a Hard Fork of Ethereum, was made as a result of a theft incident on the blockchain.

A Hard Fork means that all participants in the network must accept the update. Otherwise, two different blockchains can be created as a result of the split. Because a Hard Fork is backward-incompatible, users and developers are forced to use updated software.

## Soft Fork:
  
A Soft Fork is an update in the blockchain protocol where backward-compatible changes are made. This type of update means that a restrictive change has been made to the rules of the existing blockchain. That is, new blocks and transactions are also considered valid by old software that is compatible with the update.

A Soft Fork can tighten existing rules or add new rules, but it does not violate valid rules. Therefore, when a Soft Fork occurs, participants using existing software on the blockchain can still process new blocks and transactions correctly.

A Soft Fork does not require all participants in the network to accept the update. A Soft Fork requires a majority of the network to use updated software. If a majority is using updated software, consensus can be achieved on the blockchain despite nodes that do not accept the update.

In summary, while a Hard Fork creates a new blockchain with backward-incompatible changes, a Soft Fork updates the existing blockchain in a compatible way. In both cases, splits and new versions can emerge in the blockchain network.
