# Gas and Gas Fees

In blockchain, the term ‘gas’ represents the computational power and resources required to perform transactions on the blockchain network. Gas is a concept used in many blockchain networks such as Ethereum. Gas is a measure of cost for each transaction or transaction step performed on the blockchain network.

Gas fee is the fee paid to perform a transaction. The gas fee is determined based on the amount of computational resources used in the transaction, the complexity of the transaction, and the demand on the blockchain network. The gas fee is used as an incentive for the party performing the transaction to provide resources to the network and for miners to include the transaction in the blockchain.

The party sending the transaction sets a gas limit when performing the transaction. The gas limit specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be spent on a transaction. If the transaction uses more gas than the gas limit, the transaction fails and the gas fee is lost. The gas limit is used to control how complex or costly the party performing the transaction can make the transaction.

The gas fee is calculated by multiplying the amount of gas used in the transaction by the gas price. The gas price is the unit price of gas and is a value determined by the party performing the transaction. The gas fee is calculated as gas fee = gas amount * gas price.

Gas fees can vary depending on the supply and demand balance on the blockchain network. In a busy network, gas prices can rise because miners want a higher incentive to include transactions in the blockchain. Setting a low gas price can extend the time it takes for your transaction to be included in the blockchain. Therefore, it is important to monitor the situation on the network to set gas prices correctly and process your transactions in a timely manner.

Gas and gas fees ensure that transactions are processed fairly on blockchain networks and prevent spam transactions. At the same time, it encourages the efficient use of resources and maintains the stability of the network.
